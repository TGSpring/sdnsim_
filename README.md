# SDNSim üõ∞Ô∏è - Software Defined Network Simulator (C++)

SDNSim is a C++ simulation of a Software Defined Network (SDN), featuring a centralized controller that manages network devices, connections, packet routing, and network clearing. This is an **educational and expandable project** built with Visual Studio to model core SDN behavior.

## üí° Features (Phase 1 Complete)

- ‚úÖ Central `Controller` that manages all devices  
- ‚úÖ `Device` class with neighbor tracking  
- ‚úÖ Add/remove devices and bidirectional connections  
- ‚úÖ Device active/inactive status  
- ‚úÖ Connection logic using unordered maps  
- ‚úÖ Topology loading from file (`topology.txt`)  
  - Supports comments, blank lines, self-loops, and duplicate connections  
- ‚úÖ Packet sending simulation with logs for success/failure  
- ‚úÖ Network reset via `clearAllDevices()`  
- ‚úÖ Fully documented with Doxygen

## üöÄ Roadmap & Planned Features

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Simulation (Complete)

- Device management, neighbor tracking, and active/inactive status  
- Packet sending simulation with verification of existence, activity, and neighbor relationship  
- Topology loading from file with comments, blank lines, duplicate/self-loop handling  
- Network clearing via `clearAllDevices()`  
- Command-line tests and Doxygen documentation  

### Phase 2 ‚Äì GUI & Interaction (Upcoming)

- Interactive GUI to add/remove devices  
- Visual display of network topology  
- Device status toggling and packet testing through GUI  
- Console log integration and optional packet flow animation  
- Optimizations like `const std::string&` for performance  

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Fault Detection & Network Simulation (Upcoming)

- Random device or link failures  
- Rerouting logic for packets if direct links fail  
- Packet statistics and logging (sent/received, success/failure)  

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Advanced Features (Optional / Future)

- AI/ML-driven routing and adaptive device state management  
- Web-based simulation (WASM)  
- Extended topologies with multiple controllers and VLAN/subnets  
- Plugin system for custom device types and packet rules

## üéØ Learning Goals

- C++ data structures (`unordered_map`, `vector`)  
- Object-oriented modeling (`Controller`, `Device`, `Packet`)  
- File parsing and topology management  
- Simulation of SDN logic, packet routing, and network resets  
- Expandability toward GUI, AI, and advanced network simulation
