 * # SDNSim Project
 *
 * SDNSim is a C++ software-defined networking simulation that models a centralized
 * controller managing network devices and packet routing.
 *
 * ## Features
 * - Device management (add, connect, monitor)
 * - Packet sending and routing
 * - Fault detection and network simulation
 *
 * ## Build and Run
 * - Use Visual Studio solution `SDNSim.sln` to build.
 * - Run the resulting executable from the `Debug` or `Release` folder.
 *
 * ## Viewing Documentation
 * Generate docs using Doxygen by running:
 * ```
 * doxygen Doxyfile
 * ```
 * Then open `docs/html/index.html` in your browser.
